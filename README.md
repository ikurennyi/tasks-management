# Tasks Management Application

Created as a test task by Ievgenii Kurennyi

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Headed Component Tests with [Cypress Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/component)

```sh
npm run test:unit:dev # or `npm run test:unit` for headless testing
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Notes and future TODOS

_As this is not a final version of the application some "tasks" will be postponed._

All todos have to be cleaned up before v.1.0.0

1. [ ] Check if the root `cypress` folder is needed.
